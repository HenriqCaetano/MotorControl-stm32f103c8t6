# MotorControl-stm32f103c8t6
Codes developed for the control of a DC motor using encoders, a STM32f103c8t6 and a MD22 motor driver. This code is still in development. 


The initial page is the entire project. The most important files are:
  -main.c: core->Src
  -encoderMotorcontrol.c: core->Src
  -encoderMotorcontrol.h: core->Inc
  -gpio.c, tim.c, usart.c: core->Src
  
  
  Thank you!
